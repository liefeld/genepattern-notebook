{"name":"GenePattern Notebook","tagline":"Code for the GenePattern Notebook","body":"GenePattern Notebook\r\n====================\r\n\r\nSome notes on setup of GenePattern Notebook environment.\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT: The current version of the code only works with GenePattern 3.9.3 and up! \r\nWe recommend GenePattern 3.9.4 (the latest version), as this version fixes a bug in the \r\nserver than can cause the Notebook to double prompt for authentication.**\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\n## Install Python\r\n\r\nIn order to get the GenePattern Notebook working you will first need to install a compatible \r\nversion of Python. This means you will need either Python 2.7 or Python 3.4+.\r\n\r\n**Note for Mac Users:** Mac comes with Python, but - depending on the version OSX you have - \r\nyou may have to update to a new version. To do this I would recommend using a package manager \r\nsuch as Homebrew or MacPorts.\r\n\r\nYou may wish to install the Anaconda distribution of Python from Continuum Analytics. This is \r\na scientific version of Python that ships with many of the most popular Python packages for \r\nscience, math and data analysis (ex: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, IPython, etc.).\r\n\r\n## Install PIP\r\n\r\nInstall PIP (Python Package Index) if not already installed (PIP may come with Anaconda \r\ndistribution; see https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html). This is Python's preferred \r\npackage management system.\r\n\r\n## Install IPython Notebook\r\nNext install IPython Notebook. This can easily be done from PIP by executing the following \r\nline of code from the terminal.\r\n\r\n> pip install \"ipython[notebook]\"\r\n\r\n## Install GenePattern Python Library\r\nThe GenePattern Notebook uses the GenePattern Python Library for many of its calls. This \r\nlibrary can be installed from PIP by running the following command:\r\n\r\n> pip install genepattern-python\r\n\r\n## Install GenePattern Notebook\r\n\r\nFor the time being, the best way to install the GenePattern Notebook is by cloning the GitHub \r\nrepository and then copying over some files from the checkout to your IPython profile. The \r\nGenePattern Notebook repository can be cloned by executing the following command:\r\n\r\n> git clone https://github.com/broadinstitute/GenePatternNotebook.git\r\n\r\n**As the GenePattern Notebook is not yet public, at this time you must be a member of the \r\nGenePattern team to access the repository.**\r\n\r\nNext, you must copy over the GenePattern Notebook extension to your IPython profile. Your \r\nprofile is by default found at ~/.ipython - a hidden directory under your user directory.\r\nYou will need to copy the client-side files needed to display the GenePattern widgets. \r\nFrom the cloned repository (whose root folder is GenePatternNotebook):\r\n\r\n> cp GenePatternNotebook/profile/profile_default/static/custom/* ~/.ipython/profile_default/static/custom/\r\n\r\n## Launch IPython\r\n\r\nFinally, you may launch the IPython notebook by issuing the following command at the terminal:\r\n\r\n> ipython notebook\r\n\r\nThis will start up the notebook kernel from and launch your web browser, pointing to the Notebook.\r\n\r\n## Note for RNA-seq Notebook Users\r\n\r\nThe RNA-seq Notebook requires an additional Python package known as jsonpickle. This package allows \r\nthe notebook to store results in memory using a JSON data format. This package may be installed by \r\nexecuting the following line of code from a terminal.\r\n\r\n> pip install -U jsonpickle\r\n\r\n# Known Issues\r\n\r\nThere is a known issue that can cause JavaScript visualizers to not display propertly unless a user \r\nfirst logs into the main GenePattern interface from the same browser before using them in the \r\nGenePattern Notebook. This is due to a security model issue in the GenePattern server. A fix is \r\nplanned for the upcoming GenePattern 3.9.5 release.\r\n\r\n# Feature Support\r\n\r\nMost common GenePattern features are supported from the GenePattern Notebook. A few, however, have \r\nyet to be implemented. GenePattern features that are not yet supported are:\r\n\r\n* Batch job submission\r\n* GenomeSpace integration\r\n* Pipeline child job output\r\n* Dynamically updated choice parameters\r\n* Parameter groups","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
